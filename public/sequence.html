However, we need to understand the core reason why we do SEO. The search engine is one of the marketing channels that potentially bring you traffic and sales for your business with unlimited reach. That is why helping users to engage with your website should be the main objective. Here are some of the SEO objectives you should set:Increase organic traffic;Fix website on-page issue;Optimize very specific metrics on Google Analytics and Search Console (eg. decrease bounce rate, increase time on page, increase page per session, increase impressions share, gain more clicks, more.Get conversion and sales;Become a market leader in a specific business sector Increase average ranking from all the targeted keywordsHow Much do You Need to Have Working SEO Strategy?Now you know how complex and urgent SEO is for your business. So, how much do you need to have a working SEO strategy? The answer will vary. At mid-level, the budget for SEO services in Southeast Asia markets is around $3000-$5000 or IDR 45.000.000 to 75.000.000. These markets involve startups and enterprises with a total market volume is about 50.000 to 150.000 visitors a month.Based on our marketing team's calculation of the Indonesia market, here is how much you need to spend on SEO services per month:Low level: $1500-$3000Mid Level: $2500-$4000High Level: $3000-$10000 Those prices will be different in every country, but we just want to show the approximate budget you need in Asian countries. Should You Have an In-house SEO Team or Outsourcing?Since you know how important it is to use your budget efficiently, you need to consider this matter. Think about how you will have an SEO team to help you achieve your business goal. If your business is stable enough to hire an SEO team (SEO specialists, SEO content writers, and developers), then you might want an in-house SEO team. However, look at the budget you will spend to have a complete in-house SEO team. Our team has calculated the approximate budget for building a junior SEO team, you will need around IDR 16 million per month. Potentially more or less,  depends on the company's negotiations with prospective employees. While, for the mid-level SEO needs, the total investment of the SEO team is IDR 23 million per month.In certain scenarios, the internal team will be more profitable for the company. For example, when the company has a plan to make a product or launch a certain service on a regular basis in a certain period. In this scenario, outsourcing costs will be more expensive.On the contrary, if you do not need a lifetime SEO plan, outsourcing an SEO team will be more efficient and effective for more business sectors, even across all business levels. You can focus on developing the company's business and managing other things for a bigger purpose. Assign your company's SEO work to the experts, and give your valuable time so that the business can develop. ConclusionAll in all, implementing SEO for business is worth the investment. It is the long-term benefits that make it imperative. Helping search engine users to find what they are looking for while offering your business is a noble duty you should carry. So, if you are able to provide high-quality content based on your targetted keywords, you will most likely dominate the search engine results.SEO can be more complex than what we explain above.
